Pupose of Software: The Purpose of this software is to implement 
and calculate matrix functions.

Files:

matrix_cpp
- matrix.h (header file that contains our Matrix class in C++)
- matrix.cpp (file that contains the matrix functionality)
- main.cpp (main file to test matrix functionality in C++)

matrix_c
- matrix.h (header file that contains our Matrix struct in C)
- matrix.c (file that contains the matrix functionality)
- main.c (main file to test matrix functionality in C)

Build Instructions:
Simply type and compile manually

- matrix_cpp: "g++ -g -o matrix_cpp main.cpp matrix.cpp" --> "./matrix_cpp"
- matrix_c: "gcc -std=c99 -o matrix_c main.c matrix.c" --> "./matrix.c"

Testing Methodology:
- Used the provided inputs and matrix function (provided in matrix
screenshot and instructions of homework)
